<h1>Net Mart</h1>

<p>I developed a responsive E-Commerce frontend using React and Redux for state management. Integrated a third-party product API to dynamically fetch and display products on the home page. I have implemented an Add to Cart functionality, allowing users to add, view, and remove products from the cart while displaying the total cart amount in real time. I have styled the UI using TailwindCSS for a clean and modern design.</p>
